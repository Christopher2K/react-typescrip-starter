# React Typescript Starter

This repository is my starter for every React App project that I start. I use:
* Babel transpiler over TSC
* Webpack as module bundler
* **Typescript !!** for sources and also configuration files
* Tslint for keeping the code clean
* and my favorite CSS in JS library, [Emotion](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion)

Feel free to fork this repo / push PR's.
